# Fireslack
Firebase slack clone.

## Requirements

1. Being a node project, `npm` should be installed. This comes with node by default.
2. For client-side dependencies, you'll need `bower`. You can install it via `npm install -g bower`.
3. The `grunt` task runner is needed, install via `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
4. You'll need a Firebase account, [sign up for one](https://www.firebase.com/).

## Installation

1. Run `npm install`. This will automatically run `bower install`.
2. Update the `FirebaseUrl` constant in the `app/app.js` to point to a new Firebase app. You can create an app from your [Firebase dashboard](https://www.firebase.com/account/#/).

## Running

To fire up the app run `npm start`.
